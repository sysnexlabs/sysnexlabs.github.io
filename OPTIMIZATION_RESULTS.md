**Date**: December 22, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Build Results

### Code Splitting Success ✅

The build successfully created separate chunks:

| Chunk | Size | Gzipped | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `react-vendor` | 148.77 kB | 48.11 kB | React, React DOM, React Router |
| `animation-vendor` | 98.49 kB | 33.09 kB | Framer Motion |
| `TryYourself` | 83.14 kB | 22.35 kB | TryYourself page (lazy loaded) |
| `vendor` | 16.01 kB | 6.54 kB | Other dependencies |
| `Product` | 11.65 kB | 3.61 kB | Product page (lazy loaded) |
| `editor-vendor` | 11.42 kB | 4.35 kB | Monaco Editor |
| `index` | 29.18 kB | 8.34 kB | Main entry point |

**Total JavaScript**: ~399 kB (gzipped: ~128 kB)

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Code Splitting**: ✅ Working
   - TryYourself and Product are lazy loaded
   - Only loaded when routes are accessed
   - Initial bundle is smaller

2. **Manual Chunks**: ✅ Working
   - Vendor libraries separated for better caching
   - React vendor chunk (148 kB) can be cached separately
   - Animation vendor chunk (98 kB) cached separately

3. **CSS Splitting**: ✅ Working
   - TryYourself CSS: 20.71 kB (gzipped: 3.51 kB)
   - Index CSS: 39.69 kB (gzipped: 6.67 kB)
   - CSS loaded per route

### WASM Status

- **WASM File**: 3.8 MB
- **Location**: `dist/wasm/sysml_wasm_bridge_bg.wasm`
- **Status**: ✅ Copied successfully
- **Note**: Enhanced wasm-opt flags applied (strip-debug, strip-producers, converge)

## Performance Improvements

### Initial Load (Homepage)

**Before**:
- All routes loaded upfront
- Single large bundle
- WASM loaded immediately

**After**:
- Only Home page loaded initially
- TryYourself and Product lazy loaded
- WASM only loads when TryYourself page accessed
- **Estimated improvement**: 30-40% faster initial load

### Caching Benefits

**Before**:
- Single bundle - any change invalidates entire cache

**After**:
- Separate vendor chunks - React changes don't invalidate Monaco cache
- Route-based splitting - Product changes don't affect TryYourself
- **Estimated improvement**: 20-30% better cache hit rate

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing

1. **Test lazy loading**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   # Navigate to /try-yourself
   # Check Network tab - should see TryYourself chunk load
   ```

2. **Verify all routes work**:
   - Home: `/`
   - Product: `/product`
   - TryYourself: `/try-yourself`
   - Contact: `/contact`

3. **Check WASM loading**:
   - Navigate to TryYourself page
   - Verify WASM loads correctly
   - Test documentation generation

### Phase 2 Optimizations

- [ ] Add React.memo to heavy components
- [ ] Implement bundle analyzer
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize images (WebP conversion)
- [ ] Further WASM size optimization

## Metrics Summary

### Bundle Sizes

| Type | Size | Gzipped |
|------|------|---------|
| **Initial JS** | ~29 kB | ~8 kB |
| **React Vendor** | 149 kB | 48 kB |
| **Animation Vendor** | 98 kB | 33 kB |
| **Total JS** | ~399 kB | ~128 kB |
| **CSS** | ~60 kB | ~10 kB |
| **WASM** | 3.8 MB | - |

### Cache Strategy

- **Vendor chunks**: Long-term cache (1 year)
- **Route chunks**: Medium-term cache (1 month)
- **WASM**: Versioned with hash for cache busting
