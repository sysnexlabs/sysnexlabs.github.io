## What PTC Corporate Taught Us

### PTC's Winning Strategy

1. **Solution-focused, not product-focused**
   - They say: "Achieve double-digit impact through digital transformation"
   - You say: "Lightning fast SysML v2 IDE"
   - **Fix**: Talk about business outcomes first, technology second

2. **Role-based navigation**
   - Engineering, Manufacturing, Service, Leadership
   - Each persona sees content relevant to their role
   - **Fix**: Add "For Engineers", "For Managers", "For Directors" sections

3. **Business outcome categories**
   - "Managing product complexity"
   - "Reducing costs"
   - "Improving product quality"
   - **Fix**: Organize by business need, not by product feature

4. **Market authority signals**
   - "95% of Fortune 500 are PTC customers"
   - IDC MarketScape leader
   - Analyst recognition
   - **Fix**: Add any validation you have (pilot programs, partnerships)

## German Translation Gaps

### Current State
- ✅ German translations **exist** in i18n.js
- ❌ Coverage is **incomplete** (~70-80% estimate)
- ❌ No other languages beyond EN/DE

### Why It Matters
- Your target market: German automotive (BMW, VW, Mercedes, Audi, Bosch)
- ASPICE and ISO 26262 are German automotive standards
- English-only signals "not ready for German enterprise"

### Quick Fix
1. Audit all English keys vs German keys (use provided script)
2. Machine translate missing keys with DeepL
3. Native German speaker review (1-2 days)
4. Ship complete German version
